Google groups  - For user questions

## Development Method

We use the standard Github pull request model for developing. We donâ€™t develop on the main Github repository and always use a fork of the repository to develop.

Here is our rough workflow.

Fork the Cylon Github
Create a branch in your for for the development
Develop the feature, fix the bug etc
Add documentation and test cases
Create a pull request
Once a pull request is created, one or two reviewers will be assigned.
Work with the reviewers to merge the pull request into the main branch.

## Development Ideas

New development ideas are listed in the Github project.

If you are interested in contributing, you can choose an issue and put your interest in it by commenting on it. A Cylon developer will join you to help getting started.
