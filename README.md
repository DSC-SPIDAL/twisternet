Cylon is a fast, scalable distributed memory data parallel library
for processing structured data. Cylon implements a set of relational operators to process data.
While ”Core  Cylon” is implemented using system level C/C++, multiple language interfaces
(Python  and  Java  (R  in  future)) are provided to seamlessly integrate with existing applications, enabling
both data and AI/ML engineers to invoke data processing operators in a familiar programming language.
By default it works with MPI for distributing the applications.

Internally Cylon uses [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) to represent the data in a column format.
